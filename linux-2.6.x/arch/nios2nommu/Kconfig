	  This option enables various assembler instructions based on your

	  "Enable mulx instruction".
	  
	  Here is an explanation of each option:
	  None = -mno-hw-mul -mno-hw-mulx
	   (no mul or mulx instructions used)
	  Enable mul instruction = -mhw-mul -mno-hw-mulx 
	   (use mul instructions)

config BREAK_ON_START
	bool "Include breakpoint trap on kernel startup"
	help
	  Configures the kernel to trap to the GDB client on startup
	  before the kernel starts initialization. This allows you to
	  debug the kernel startup.

config LARGE_ALLOCS
	bool "Allow allocating large blocks (> 1MB) of memory"
	help
	  Allow the slab memory allocator to keep chains for very large
	  memory sizes - upto 32MB. You may need this if your system has
	  a lot of RAM, and you need to able to allocate very large
	  contiguous chunks. If unsure, say N.

choice
	prompt "Kernel executes from"

	  Choose the memory type that the kernel will be running in.

config RAMKERNEL
	bool "RAM"
	help
	  The kernel will be resident in RAM when running.

#config ROMKERNEL

config PREEMPT
	bool "Preemptible Kernel"
	help
	  This option reduces the latency of the kernel when reacting to
	  real-time or interactive events by allowing a low priority process to
	  be preempted even if it is in kernel mode executing a system call.
	  This allows applications to run more reliably even when the system is
	  under load.

	  Say Y here if you are building a kernel for a desktop, embedded
	  or real-time system.  Say N if you are unsure.

config PREEMPT_TIMES
	bool "Collect preemption latency times"
	depends on PREEMPT
	help
	  Allow collection for preemption latency times.

config CMDLINE
	string "Default kernel command string"
	default "CONSOLE=/dev/ttyS0 root=/dev/rom0 ro"
	help
	  On some architectures, there is currently no way
	  for the boot loader to pass arguments to the kernel. For these
	  architectures, you should supply some command-line options at build
	  time by entering them here. As a minimum, you should specify the
	  memory size and the root device (e.g., mem=64M root=/dev/nfs).

config PASS_CMDLINE
	bool "Passed kernel command line from u-boot"
	default n
	help
	  Use bootargs env variable from u-boot for kernel command line.
	  will override "Default kernel command string".
          Say N if you are unsure.

config BOOT_LINK_OFFSET
	hex "Link address offset for booting"

	help
	  This option allows you to set the link address offset of the zImage.
	  This can be useful if you are on a board which has a small amount of
	  memory.

config HOTPLUG
	bool "Support for hot-pluggable device"
	  ---help---
	  Say Y here if you want to plug devices into your computer while
	  the system is running, and be able to use them quickly.  In many
	  cases, the devices can likewise be unplugged at any time too.

	  One well known example of this is PCMCIA- or PC-cards, credit-card
	  size devices such as network cards, modems or hard drives which are
	  plugged into slots found on all modern laptop computers.  Another
	  example, used on modern desktops as well as laptops, is USB.

	  Enable HOTPLUG and KMOD, and build a modular kernel.  Get agent
	  software (at <http://linux-hotplug.sourceforge.net/>) and install it.
	  Then your kernel will automatically call out to a user mode "policy
	  agent" (/sbin/hotplug) to load modules and set up software needed
	  to use devices as you hotplug them.

	  If you say Y here the resulting kernel image will be slightly larger

	  If you don't debug the kernel, you can say N, but we may not be able
	  to solve problems without frame pointers.
