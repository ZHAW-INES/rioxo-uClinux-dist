	look into region copy on xoff/yoff != 0 in GsPrepareDrawing

notifyactivate in nanowm should check all child windows (qt bug)

change stipple/tile unsigned short to MWIMAGEBITS, use GdBitmap
seperate out dashed and stipple in config file and devdraw.c

change to GrChangeGC instead of new GrSetXXX routines?
***typedef CheckEvent in nanox/client.c
GetTypedEventPred - typedef CheckEvent, remove params??
