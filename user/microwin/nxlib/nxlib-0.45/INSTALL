NXLIB build and installation instructions
Version 0.44, May 30, 2003

1. Modify Makefile to set Microwindows and X11 include and lib directories
	MWIN=/usr2/microwin/src
	X11=/usr/X11R6

	Microwindows v0.90 or later must be used.

2. Modify Makefile to set X11 PCF font search directories (2)
	X11_FONT_DIR1=/usr/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi
	X11_FONT_DIR2=/usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc

3. Modify Makefile to set rgb.txt file location
	X11_RGBTXT=/usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt

4. Modify Makefile to enable X11 shared library and version if desired
	SHAREDLIB=Y
	LIBNAME = X11
	SOLIBREV = 6.2
	CFLAGS += -DXCONST=_Xconst

	Because of X11 hdr version inconstencies, you may need to set 
		CFLAGS += -DXCONST=_Xconst  or  CFLAGS += -DXCONST=
	to compile _Xconst in or out of a couple of function declarations.

5. Type "make".
	This builds the library using your already-installed X11 headers.
	If DEBUG = -g, a larger library will be built with debug information.
	If INCLUDE_XRM=Y, unmodified Xrm database routines will be included.

6. DO NOT "make install" UNTIL YOU BACK UP THE FOLLOWING LIBRARIES.
   NOTE "make install" WILL BY DEFAULT OVERWRITE THE FOLLOWING FILES:

	/usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.so.*
	(/usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.so /usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.so.6 /usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.so.6.2)
