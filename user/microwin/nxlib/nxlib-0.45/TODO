clipping on oval windows on fltk forms
width/height vs radius in Arc draws buggy for all even widths
	fltk valuators dial problems, arc/fill borders incorrect
	fltk forms round down border problem, fltk radio buttons
make Xt programs work
handle shift/control/alt in X kbd state
get scancode keymap from microwindows
fill in events for UPDATE event handling
	fix in .window and .parent locations for *Notify events
send ReparentNotify seperately in addition to ConfigureNotify
scrollbars still don't work w/gtk
likely have to make XSetGraphicsExposures work for scrolling in qt
XPutBackEvent doesn't work with XCheckEvent
add time fields in nano-X events for X11 compatibility
strdup/free check
mwin font additions for XCharStruct deficiencies
	no 256 limit on XCharStruct entry in QueryFont
	this needs change in TextExt.c as well
man pages X style -> html
check ascent/baseline in XDrawString/Text
byte2 might be incorrect when fontsize > 256
test XListFonts with -* and other wildcards
ChangeProperty needs checking
implement Xext as well
allow multiple GrOpen/GrClose calls for multiple XOpenDisplay calls
implement QLength() dpy->qlen
fill in font structure
fix ParentRelative in XSetWindowBackgroundPixmap

arc drawing in nano-X is broken (sonar)
XAllocColor doesn't actually write colormap in truecolor mode: error?
	no colormap entries unless palette mode?
Fix putImage depth = 1 (ace freecell)
***_XConst issues between systems...
expose events don't work in qt
implement GrCopyRegion, must copy region in XSetClipMask, XSetRegion
	perhaps need to set rectangles only in NX
implement PutPixel1
depth = 1 in XCreateImage... (flag.c) SLOW
XMapRaised also maps children...
VisibilityChangeMask -> SubstructureNotifyMask??
can't call XSetForeground within lib cause of saved Gc values
look through FIXMEs (CrGC.c?)
check depth = 1 in other cases of XCreatePixmapFromBitmapData
	add MWMONOPIXMAP flag, then use GC fg/bg during CopyArea
	XCopyArea check bpp = 1 remove
	CopyArea must use GC mode during copy
copyright notice...
16bpp only for XGetImage in Image.c
fix Shape.c ShapeClip/ShapeBounding
helvR08 bug between X systems - get X11 version #
remove dependency issue with -lXext and xfreecell

add X11 include files for compilation?
sunclock still doesn't work with -fg green -bg blue

TRUECOLOR332 bug in OpenDis

Atoms, Window Properties and X11 font managment are located here and not in the server.
These may need to be moved over for desktop and other stuff to work.  

allow mwin to take pixelval rather than colorval in COLORVAL routines

change to Query Truecolor or not for display

think about GrReadArea return size based on MWPF_xxx
	should it be based on bpp?  no.

XSetClipMask creates a region leak - GrDestroyGC doesn't deallocate resources

is Cursor black/white reversed? (X11 bits reverse meaning?)

Region.c local regions?

fix/check bitmaps on qdir demo
need way to turn off wm on popup windows (qdir)
closeboxes don't automatically work on qt

XPutImage: GrArea doesn't translate pixels yet to different hw format

need XGrabPointer for qt, popdowns for qt
add more XChangeWindowAttributes value, add XCreateWindow?
add SetWMHints stuff
