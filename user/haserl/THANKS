Haserl THANKS file

Haserl was written by Nathan Angelacos.  

It was the result of work done by Cameron Banta and David Krause, who 
wrote a web-configuration engine using AWK scripts.

Natanael Copa assisted with the autoconf scripts, as well as general 
support of the project.

Arne Bernin submitted the first patch to make the shell variables
survive code blocks.  His comments and ideas got the whole sub-shell
thing going.

Erich Titl helped with some of the configure automake checks.

Vladislav Moskovets suggested the include directive.

Andreas Brodmann provided the incentive to do haserll (lua)
